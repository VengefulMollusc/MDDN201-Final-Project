The HTML file included in here is a proof of concept, showing an earlier version of my project running in-browser.
Note I haven't built this version of the code for Javascript conversion, thus there are some glitches with the colours.
(It's also running pretty slowly in-browser, although I'm running it on a tablet at the moment).

As noted in my documentation, it turns out that the Minim plugin for Processing doens't convert to Javascript,
meaning it is impossible for me to get my final product running in a browser without practically rewriting it.
